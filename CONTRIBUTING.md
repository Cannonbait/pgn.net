Contributing
============
Please contribute to pgn.NET! We welcome all changes (although we might not merge any change).

Go ahead and submit small fixes and changes, but it you have something major to contribute, it's nice to first discuss it with one of the owners via an issue.

We're still working on a code of conduct we feel at home in, but in the meantime, please be civil towards us and each other in all your interactions with the project.
